# Overlay Clock
A nondescript clock that draws over full-screen applications. _Windows only_.

## Description
Need to watch your time closely while loading into the next round of your favorite game?
Tired of "Alt-Tab-ing" to check the time while you should be aiming down-sights?
Look no further than **Overlay Clock**!

When run, Overlay Clock will draw over any application on your screen and simply report the system time. That's all.
